# HOWTO

- Copy `.env.default` file to `.env`
- Run `npm install` command
- Run `npm start` command


## Nuances

- Had not enough time to finish movement to the next photo
- Had not enough time to clean the `Dashboard` prev/next handlers code

## Requests

- You should warn your attendees that they will have to set up the project from scratch. Process takes a time especially when you work with `typescript`.
